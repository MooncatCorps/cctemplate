# CC Template

CCTemplate is a template that functions as a base for C++ based projects.

It is currently somewhat simple and holds lacking support for cross-platform
adaptability and perhaps external tool integration. However, in it's current
state it provides a solid quickstart for any general purpose C++ project.

It is currently based on LLVM's Clang, however and as always, slight tweaks
can be made to the provided makefile to have it work with any other compiler.

## To-dos:
- Integrate CMake
- Integrate practical dependency addition
